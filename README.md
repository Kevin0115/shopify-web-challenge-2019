# Shopify Web Challenege 2019

*Welcome, Shopify team!*

Here you'll find my submission for the Shopify Web Challenege for Summer 2019, which was tailored with ReactJS.

Please feel free to browse my code!

A few notes regarding implementation details:
- There is automatic window scaling; feel free to try it out
- A message will be displayed if there are no search results onscreen; this avoids "emptiness"
- Searches are based on *keywords only*, as this is what the spec seemed to aim for
- Partial keyword searches are accepted (non-whole words can be search for an will return results), as this was not mentioned in the spec

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
